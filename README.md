# What is FuckYouBot?
Simple Discord bot written in Py3 that has a 10% chance of randomly sending a desired message.

# Why?
Made this as a joke because my friend told me so, simplest main.py I've ever written lmao.

# How do I install it?
Simply clone this repo or download the "main.py" file, and then run it using Python3.
PS: Remember to add your bot token and edit your custom message on the file!
